	<h1 class="P"> Introduction to the World Wide Web (WWW):Explain how the web works, the role of web servers, what are web browsers?</h1>
	<p class="okBoomer"> The web or more formally known the World Wide Web is a collection of web pages that can be accessed by your web browser. The Internet allows your computer to access web pages from the world wide web. <br></p><p class="okBoomer">
		When you insert a URL into your web browser such as www.google.com your web browser directs your internet to connect to google's server and retrieves the web page from a web server. A web server is a type of powerful computer that is specifically suited for storing and sending web pages. These usually use dedicated operating systems that are different from typical computer softwares which allow this process to be quicker and more reliable. Furthermore, if too many requests are being sent to a webserver at once it could crash access to the web page or cause congestions and make the experience slow. This is why it is vital for companies to correctly judge traffic to their websites and set up their web servers accordingly. <br></p>

	<p class="okBoomer">
		Nowadays however, most web pages are accessed through something known as a search engine such as google. Web pages are set up with things called search engine spiders. The spider scans web pages and creates indexes of key words which are uploaded to the search engine’s databases. Afterwards, the spider ‘crawls’ to the next site through links found on this page and repeats its process. By searching for ‘cat videos’ on google, the search engine looks through its database and links you to the most relevant web pages. When you click on a webpage your computer is sending a request just like it would with a URL and is sent back the web page files. <br></p><p class="okBoomer">
		Web page files are similar to common word files but usually operate with special coding languages such as HTML. Hypertext Markup Language or HTML is a language which allows website coders to design websites that are laid out in a logical and intuitive style and bring more media such as videos and gifs to the world wide web. Furthermore HTML works closely with other web coding languages such as CSS (Cascading style sheets) and Java script to give websites a nicer design with colour schemes or just to add cool games.<br></p><p class="okBoomer">
		 But how does your computer understand this? This is where the web browser comes in. It reads the programming language of the web page and is able to represent that in the way the code expresses. While most modern web browsers support most of the functions of HTML5 (the latest version of HTML) some don’t meaning you may not see the web page how it's properly intended. For example internet explorer lacks the ability for features such as web notifications and some forms of date inputs. Furthermore, more modern web browsers embed search engines into the address bar, allow browser extensions such as ad blockers and have many more flashy features to get you to their side. Most web browsers make money by taking a commision from the ads put on search engines or are made to be bundled with the operating system such as safari, edge and internet explorer.
		 <h1 class="P">How is the web different to the internet?</h1>
		 <p class="okBoomer">While commonly confused the World wide web and internet are quite different things that work hand in hand. The internet is a series of connections that connect computers around the globe to together and to other servers. On the other hand the world wide web or web for short is a place in which a series of specially formatted documents are kept. These documents are kept in a system of web servers. To gather this web of information your computer uses the internet.<br> </p> <div class="squareL">
 
		 <p class="okBoomer">When you search for www.youtube.com , your computer sends a data signal (made up from many packets) to your router. Next your router will direct your data signal to your ISP or internet service provider. Your internet service provider is a company that has large network infrastructure to handle peoples internet requests and send them possibly around the globe and back. An example of an internet service provider is Telstra. When your data reaches your ISP it can be directed to a web server. Once your data request reaches this server it requests for a web page. The web server sends back the requested web page and travels back the appropriate path to your device. <br> </p>
		 <p class="okBoomer"> The internet is quite a  complex system but let's think about it in another way. When you are in a library and search for a book you will move around the library floor which is like the internet. Then to find the specific book your looking for you will ask the librarian who would direct like your ISP would. Then you will get to a bookshelf where the books are stored which is like the web servers. The internet plays a vital part in the ability to browse the web and the way you use your computer.<br></p>
		 <h1 class="P"> What is an Intranet? How does it relate to the internet?</h1>
		 <p class="okBoomer">An intranet is a private networking system usually used for enterprise or educational purposes. Usually an Intranet is used to support employees or to inform them about what is happening in their workplace. Examples of their purposes are for discussion, collaboration, newsletters and private document access. <br></p>
		 <p class="okBoomer"> At our we have an intranet in the form of Sentral which is a platform made by a third party company. It is accessed through the World Wide Web but has restricted access to only people of our school. Sentral allows the school to communicate with each other easily and access important information relevant to work or school work. For example the school calendar is used to help plan out excursions and exams to ensure that they don’t align on the same days. <br></p> <div class="square">

  <p class="cap">A template of an external intranet hosted on Sharepoint</p>
  </div>
		 <p class="okBoomer">A lot of the time Intranet's use the companies LAN or local access network. This ensures that the companies possibly confidential files are not leaked to the wider web. Furthermore the intranet system that use LAN still use all similar web software and protocols such as HTML5 and are still accessed through web browsers. With this system a web server would be put in the organisations server room and instead of having to connect through the ISP and then the web server a direct connection between your work computer and the server. Furthermore these systems are usually created by companies and suited to your organisation's needs. They will usually setup the web servers as well. However they require to be accessed only at work meaning they are limit workers from working remotely, furthermore these systems are expensive and take longer to recieve updates and revisions.<br></p>
		 <p class="okBoomer">Nowadays external hosting an intranet system is usually used. These systems take advantage of the internet fully allowing access through the World Wide Web. They have special security measures meaning only workers with passwords to the intranet can have any access. This gives more flexibility to the system as it can be accessed from anywhere relatively securely. These services are usually controlled by external companies and is run through their servers completely remotely. This is extremely beneficial as it allows this third party company to continually work on vulnerabilities and updates that add more functionality to the Intranet. If the system crashes, this external company is able to quickly fix the issue without having to go to the workplace. <br></p>
		 <p class="okBoomer">Both techniques of operation use internet infrastructure extensively. Lan hosted systems use the networking systems in the building such as ethernet and wifi to connect to the locally hosted web server. On the other hand externally hosted intranets completely take advantage of the internet and web and are accessed through an ISP but are restricted to members of a certain organisation. <br></p>
		 <h1 class="P">What is an internet protocol? Compare HTTP, TCP/IP and FTP</h1>
		 <p class="okBoomer">Simply put, an internet protocol is a set of rules placed on the format of a file before it is sent out through the internet. It is a form of standardisation that is necessary for communication with other computers and servers. These rules instruct the packets of data (data files that travel through the internet) routing to ensure they go to the right place and return home correctly. When the packets travel across the internet, a ‘layer’ of information with the servers IP (standardised internet address system) is added so that the packet can return the same way with the file. You can think of this like some rocks placed along the packets path to ensure it can go back home.<br></p>
		 <p class="okBoomer">TCP/IP is a very important process internet protocol. TCP/IP is extremely useful in the process of HTTP and FTP. TCP/IP is the protocols and ways that the packets travel from the client to the server and vice versa. IP addresses are just the way different servers and computers are identified. The main part of the TCP/IP protocol is the TCP part. TCP handles the packet ordering and is what checks for errors. TCP is a very reliable process. It breaks up the data into many small bits and has this travel through different paths. This way if one packet is missing only that one needs to be sent. This makes web page fetching very reliable however also quite slower since it has to send many files back and forth. <br></p> <div class="squareL">
 <img src="Hun.png" class="pineL">
  <p class="cap"> Image of one of the various paths a TCP/IP packet takes</p>
  </div>
		 <p class="okBoomer">HTTP or HyperText Transfer Protocol is by far the most popular internet protocol. It gets this by being the most powerful protocol and the easiest to understand. HTTP does not only carry web pages and HTML files but it can carry many different medias such as video and javascript as well. One important aspect of HTTP is that the two commands that come after each other are not linked. This means that the last command won’t know what you just performed, so saving data like shopping baskets does not work. This however is usually remedied through cookies which can store this data and communicate this with the current command. HTTP also relies on TCP/IP to transport.This means that before clients and server can connect, they need to connect using a TCP connection first. This slows down the process as it requires multiple signals to be sent before the web page can finally arrive at its destination. While improvisations to HTTP have began to fix this it still isn’t perfect. While there are some experiments happening to find a different travelling type that is better than TCP/IP connection there are no plans to completely change this in the near future. <br></p>
		 <p class="okBoomer">FTP or File transfer protocol is a specialised protocol that makes it fast to transfer large files. It  works with two connection paths. These paths are both based off the TCP protocol. One is only for communication with the server and the other is the path that sends the large chunks of data file. This is used when downloading files off the internet. Usually this process is locked with password protection but can also work anonymously. <br></p>
