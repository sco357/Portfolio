	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li class="okBoomer"> I have been playing guitar for over a year. My favourite song I have learnt would probably be Stairway to heaven by Led Zepplin. Right now I am learning Autumn Leaves by Paul Desmond.<br></li>
		<li class="okBoomer">I have always been really intrested in computers from tinkering with settings to opening them up. When I was 10 I built my first desktop computer and it was a really fun and informative experience. <br></li>
		<li class="okBoomer">I enjoy playing video games especially with my friends. My favourite games would have to be minecraft and roblox because I played them so much when I was younger but games like the just cause series and the uncharted series are pretty good.<br></li>
		<li class="okBoomer"> While I am not particularly great at sports I enjoy staying fit. Prior to the Corona virus outbreak I would swim three times a week and go to a taekwondo class twice a week. </li>

		<p1 class="write" style="text-align: center;">As my minor elective I chosce IST or Information Software Technology. In IST we do some theory which isn't super fun but I really find working on projects fun. This term our project was to work on coding a website in html. The experience was new to me and a challenging one but it also enriched me with a lot of new coding knowledge I didnthave prior. I really enjoyed coding funny websites such as the earthworm sally website and Yo Tengo search which allowed me to learn oding through my personal interests. Overall I am quite satisfied with my choice as IST as my minor elective. While there is a lot of theory to learn and it could be frustrating at times it also proves really rewarding.<p1>

		<p2 class="write" style="text-align: center;">As my major elctive I chosce Music major. I have been playing guitar for over a year now. In music major we do quite a bit of theory which can get quite boring at times, however its really fun when we get to do practicals. It allows me to play with my friends and try new instruments. This term we were working on jazz for our assessment and it was quite intresting to learn about its origins and play a style of music I had put too much thought into previously. Furthermore as a class project we were reherasing the song 'where is the love' in a class ensemble. I was playing bass and it was quite intresting putting my guitar knowledge to the bass. While music can be challenging and boring at times it never fails at being a new experience and was a great choice as a major elective.<p1>
